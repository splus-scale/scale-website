# The Survey
The Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) {% cite splus %} is observing over 9,000 square degrees of the southern sky with the 0.8 m T80-South telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in Chile. With sharp 0.55 arcsec/pixel resolution and typical depths of 20-21 AB mag, its 12-band Javalambre filter system {% cite jplus %} captures both broad and narrow spectral features, offering a unique window into the physical processes shaping galaxies across cosmic time.


# The Project
S-PLUS Clusters/Groups and their Large-scale Environments (SCALE; Mendes de Oliveira et al. 2026, in prep.) explores how galaxies grow, evolve, and interact within clusters, groups, and the vast cosmic web that connects them. Using images from the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS), SCALE combines 12-filter optical data with public spectroscopy and high-resolution imaging to reveal the structure and history of galaxies, from dense cluster cores to their outermost regions, extending up to five times the cluster's virial radius.
