  Within the framework of the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS), we introduce **S**-PLUS **C**lusters **A**nd **L**arge-scale **E**nvironments (SCALE), a project dedicated to the study of galaxy clusters, groups, and their environments using 12-band photometry of S-PLUS combined with spectroscopic and photometric data from the literature. In this first paper, we present a catalog of 83 previously known systems in the redshift range $$0.008 \leq z_{\rm spec} \leq 0.1$$, for which we derive $$R_{200}$$, $$M_{200}$$, and velocity dispersions. Spectroscopic members are selected and matched with S-PLUS photometric redshifts (photo-$$z$$s). We find excellent agreement between literature spectroscopic redshifts (spec-$$z$$s) and S-PLUS photometric redshifts (photo-$$z$$s), demonstrating the potential of the latter for cluster and group membership determination. As a proof of concept, we obtain photometric memberships for Abell 4038 using the Reliable Photometric Membership technique. A two- and three-dimensional analysis of the region within $$10 h^{-1}$$ Mpc ($$10\times R_{200}$$) from the center of Abell 4038 reveals about a dozen substructures including two additional clusters within $$1.3\times R_{200}$$ (Abell 4038B and Abell 4049). A color–luminosity segregation analysis shows that more luminous (less luminous) galaxies are redder (bluer),  as expected. Low-concentration galaxies ($$C \leq 2.5$$) exhibit a weaker color–luminosity dependence, compared to higher-concentration ones, indicating mass-dependent evolutionary pathways that challenge a simple morphology–color dichotomy, with low-luminosity galaxies presenting bluer colors largely independent of concentration. The SCALE catalog provides a valuable basis for future studies of large-scale structures and their connection to galaxy evolution.
